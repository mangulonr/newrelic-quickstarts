  ## Postfix queue performance monitoring

  Postfix monitoring involves tracking and analyzing metrics related to the performance, health, and security of a Postfix mail server. This includes monitoring the mail queue, message traffic, error logs, and security. It can also be used to set up dashboards and alerts for monitoring Postfix metrics in real-time. Proper monitoring of Postfix can ensure the smooth operation and security of the mail server.

  ### What should you look for in a Postfix dashboard?

  Postfix monitoring dashboards provide real-time statistics on mail queues, message traffic, resource utilization, error logs, and security.
